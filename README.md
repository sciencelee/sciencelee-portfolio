Flask Portfolio Website for Aaron Lee

## Project Overview
Goal is to create a personal portfolio website featuring my data science and other coding projects.

## Description 
The website is built with Flask and hosted on Heroku.  The individual pages are extensions of the template (template.html).
Alterable text is from an imported python file for convenience (helper.py).

Final project is hosted at www.sciencelee.com
